# Cancer Alpha Project

This project aims to develop AlphaFold-level innovation in cancer genomics through multi-modal cancer classification.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for training, preprocessing, and evaluation
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `models/`: Trained model artifacts
- `configs/`: Configuration files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `results/`: Model results and analysis
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts

## Getting Started

1. Activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate cancer-alpha
   ```

2. Run preprocessing:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

## Next Steps

This project follows a five-phase roadmap to achieve breakthrough innovation in precision oncology:

1. **Phase 1**: Reframe the Scientific Problem
2. **Phase 2**: Technical and Model Innovation
3. **Phase 3**: Generalization and Biological Discovery
4. **Phase 4**: Systemization and Tool Deployment
5. **Phase 5**: Manuscript Rewriting and Submission

The goal is to make this the AlphaFold of precision oncology.
