- **Cancer Samples**: 5
- **Control Samples**: 0

### 4-Source Model (Enhanced)
- **Samples**: 5
- **Features**: 74
- **Cancer Samples**: 5
- **Control Samples**: 0

## Model Performance

### 3-Source Model
- **Accuracy**: 1.000 ± 0.000

### 4-Source Model
- **Accuracy**: 1.000 ± 0.000

### Improvement
- **Absolute**: 0.000
- **Relative**: 0.0%

## ICGC ARGO Contribution

### Features Added
- **Count**: 27 new features from ICGC ARGO
- **Types**: Mutation data, copy number alterations, structural variations, pathway mutations, clinical annotations

### Top Contributing ICGC Features
- cn_instability
- cn_deletions

3. **ICGC Data Value**: ICGC ARGO contributes unique genomic insights including mutation burden, pathway alterations, and clinical annotations

4. **Integration Success**: Successfully combined heterogeneous data sources while maintaining model interpretability

## Data Sources Integration

- **TCGA**: Methylation and copy number data
- **GEO**: Fragmentomics and cfDNA patterns  
- **ENCODE**: Chromatin accessibility
- **ICGC ARGO**: Mutation profiles, structural variations, pathway data

## Files Generated

- four_source_integrated_data.csv
- three_source_feature_importance.csv
- four_source_feature_importance.csv
- four_source_comparison.png
- integration_report.json

## Recommendations

1. **Validation**: Test the 4-source model on independent datasets
2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional ICGC-derived features
3. **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune hyperparameters for the enhanced feature space
4. **Biological Interpretation**: Investigate the biological significance of top ICGC features

## Conclusion

The integration of ICGC ARGO as a fourth data source successfully enhances the multi-modal cancer detection framework. The additional genomic information provides complementary predictive power and biological insights.
