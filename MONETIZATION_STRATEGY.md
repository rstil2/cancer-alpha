- Unique positioning
- Solves real hospital pain point
- Higher value proposition

## üèÜ **Why This Will Work**

### **You Have Unique Advantages:**
1. **Working integration** (most don't)
2. **Hospital-ready documentation** (rare)
3. **Multiple EMR connectors** (very valuable)
4. **Plug-and-play deployment** (extremely rare)

### **Market Timing:**
- Hospitals want AI but struggle with integration
- AI companies need hospital deployment help
- Integration expertise is scarce and expensive

### **Low Risk:**
- Use existing system (no new development)
- Service-based revenue (immediate cash flow)
- Can always pivot back to AI development later
