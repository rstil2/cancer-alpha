# Cancer Genomics AI Classifier - Change Log

## Date: July 28, 2025

### **Immediate Actions Completed âœ…**

#### 1. **Validation Tests** 
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created comprehensive validation test suite (`tests/comprehensive_validation.py`)
  - Implemented 6 different test scenarios:
    1. Normal Operation (10 samples) - PASS
    2. Extreme Values (15 samples) - PASS 
    3. Zero Values (3 samples) - PASS
    4. NaN Handling (3 samples) - PASS
    5. Batch Consistency - PASS
    6. Cancer Type Coverage - PASS
  - **Overall Success Rate**: 100% (6/6 tests passed)
  - **Key Findings**:
    - Model handles extreme values robustly
    - Consistent predictions across batch sizes
    - Proper NaN handling with fallback to zeros
    - Average confidence scores: 70-87%
    - Model can predict multiple cancer types (BRCA, KIRC confirmed in coverage test)

#### 2. **Documentation Update**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Updated README.md to reflect new optimized Multi-Modal Transformer

  - Added gradient-based attribution methods
  - Integrated Integrated Gradients for feature attribution
  - Enhanced biological insight generation with cancer-type-specific interpretations
  - Created modality importance analysis framework
  - Added visualization functions for attention weights and feature attributions

#### 6. **Production API Deployment**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created comprehensive FastAPI production backend (`api/main.py`)
  - Integrated optimized transformer model with full API endpoints
  - Implemented authentication, security, and CORS middleware
  - Added health checks, model info, single/batch prediction endpoints
  - Integrated advanced explainer for attention weights and biological insights
  - Created deployment script (`api/start_api.sh`) with production/dev modes
  - Added comprehensive API test suite (`api/test_api.py`) with 7 test scenarios
  - Implemented Redis caching support and performance monitoring
  - Created requirements file with all production dependencies
