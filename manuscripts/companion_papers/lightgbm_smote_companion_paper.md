## 1. Introduction

Cancer classification from genomic data has emerged as one of the most promising applications of machine learning in precision medicine. The ability to accurately classify cancer types from molecular profiles can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment selection, and patient outcomes. However, this task presents unique challenges including high-dimensional feature spaces, limited sample sizes, class imbalance, and the inherent complexity of biological systems.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project has provided an unprecedented resource for cancer genomics research, containing comprehensive molecular characterization of over 33 different cancer types. Despite this wealth of data, achieving high classification accuracy on real TCGA data remains challenging due to the factors mentioned above.

Traditional approaches to cancer classification have employed various machine learning techniques, from support vector machines to deep neural networks. While these methods have shown promise, they often struggle with the specific challenges posed by genomic data, particularly class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality.

In this work, we present a novel approach that combines LightGBM gradient boosting with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address these challenges systematically. Our method achieves 95.0% balanced accuracy on real TCGA data, representing a significant advancement in the field.
