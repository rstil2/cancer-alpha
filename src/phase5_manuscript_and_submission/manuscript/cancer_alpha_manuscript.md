## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The landscape of cancer genomics has been transformed by the availability of large-scale multi-modal datasets from initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) ARGO. These resources provide unprecedented opportunities for developing AI-driven approaches to cancer classification and prognosis.

However, despite significant advances in machine learning methodologies, there remains a critical gap between research prototypes and production-ready systems capable of real-world clinical deployment. Existing approaches typically focus on algorithmic development without addressing the comprehensive infrastructure requirements for clinical applications, including scalability, security, monitoring, and regulatory compliance.

### 1.2 The AlphaFold Paradigm

AlphaFold revolutionized structural biology not merely through algorithmic innovation, but by delivering a complete, production-ready system that could be immediately deployed and utilized by researchers worldwide. The AlphaFold success demonstrates that transformative scientific impact requires both methodological excellence and comprehensive system engineering.

Cancer Alpha applies this paradigm to precision oncology, delivering not just improved classification algorithms, but a complete production system ready for clinical deployment.

This study aims to:
1. Develop a production-ready AI system for multi-modal cancer genomics classification
2. Integrate data from four major genomic databases (TCGA, GEO, ENCODE, ICGC ARGO)
3. Implement comprehensive infrastructure for clinical deployment
