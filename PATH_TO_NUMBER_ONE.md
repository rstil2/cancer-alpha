## üé¨ **The Bottom Line: It's Absolutely Possible**

**Oncura CAN become the #1 cancer AI system in the world, but it requires:**

1. **Brutal honesty** about current state (you're at ~500th place)
2. **Massive investment** ($185M-370M over 5 years)
3. **World-class execution** across AI, clinical, regulatory, and commercial
4. **5-7 year timeline** with aggressive milestones
5. **No shortcuts** - must do the hard work of real clinical validation

**The opportunity is massive:** The current leaders (Foundation Medicine, Tempus) are vulnerable to AI-first disruption. Their approaches are largely rule-based and manual.

**Your advantage:** You already built the hospital integration framework. That's 18 months ahead of where most AI startups would start.

**The path is clear.** Execute this plan aggressively, and Oncura can absolutely become the world's #1 cancer AI system.

**Ready to do what it takes?**
