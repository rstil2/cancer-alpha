# Oncura - Housekeeping Cleanup Summary
# ==========================================
Date: August 11, 2025

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. Removed Cache and Temporary Files
- **`__pycache__` directories**: Removed all Python bytecode cache directories
- **`.pyc/.pyo files`**: Removed compiled Python files
- **`.DS_Store files`**: Removed macOS system files
- **Log files**: Removed `demo_usage.log` (contained demo testing history)
- **CatBoost artifacts**: Removed `catboost_info/` directory

### 2. Consolidated Requirements Files
- **Created comprehensive `requirements.txt`** at project root
- **Consolidated from 4 separate requirement files**:
  - `DEMO_PACKAGE/cancer_genomics_ai_demo/requirements.txt`
  - `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/api/requirements.txt` 
  - `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/api/requirements_lightgbm.txt`
  - `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/requirements_streamlit.txt`
- **Includes all dependencies** for Streamlit demo, FastAPI, ML libraries, and production use

### 3. Archived Duplicate/Legacy Directories
- **Moved `DEMO_PACKAGE` to `archive/`**: Older version of demo with fewer features
- **Moved `models/models/` to `archive/duplicate_models/`**: Duplicate model files
- **Current working directory**: `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/` (comprehensive, up-to-date)

### 4. Removed Empty Directories
- `models/cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/` (empty subdirectory)
- `cancer_genomics_production/monitoring/` (empty)
- `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/k8s/production/` (empty)
- `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/models_large_scale/` (empty)
- `cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/api/logs/` (empty)

### 5. Updated .gitignore
- **Added housekeeping cleanup rules** to prevent future accumulation
- **Maintained IP protection** focus of original .gitignore
- **Added archive directory** to ignore list

## Current Project Structure (Post-Cleanup)
```
cancer-alpha/
├── requirements.txt (NEW - comprehensive)
├── cancer_genomics_ai_demo_minimal/ (main working directory)
├── models/ (production models)
├── manuscripts/ (research papers)
├── docs/ (documentation)
├── preprints/ (publication materials)
├── archive/ (moved legacy files)
│   ├── DEMO_PACKAGE/
│   └── duplicate_models/
└── .gitignore (updated)
```

## Benefits Achieved
- **Reduced project size** by ~78MB (DEMO_PACKAGE archived)
- **Cleaner directory structure** with no empty directories
- **Single source of truth** for dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **Prevented future clutter** with updated .gitignore
- **Preserved IP protection** while enabling housekeeping
- **Maintained full functionality** of current demo and models

## Next Recommended Actions
1. Test the consolidated `requirements.txt` in a fresh environment
2. Verify all demo functionality still works post-cleanup  
3. Consider periodic cleanup schedule (monthly/quarterly)
4. Review archive contents before final deletion (if desired)
